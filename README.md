I'm a Cyber Analyst with a strong focus on cybersecurity, actively working towards becoming a Cloud Security Specialist. With a passion for securing cloud environments, my long-term career path is to transition into a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) role, where I can help organizations align their security practices with industry regulations and standards.

## Objective
My work revolves around understanding security threats, mitigating risks, and ensuring best practices are applied in various cybersecurity domains. Here on GitHub, you'll find projects that highlight my journey‚Äîfrom incident response and threat analysis to exploring cloud security solutions and aligning with compliance frameworks.

I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and connect with others in the field. Feel free to explore my projects, contribute, or get in touch!

Together, let's secure the digital future!
